Pull requests are always highly welcome to fix bugs, add solvers, or
anything else!

Also see the Sundials.jl package, which provides wrappers for the excellent
Sundials ODE solver library.

# API discussions
There are currently discussions about how the Julian API for ODE solvers should look like, and the current documentation is more like a wishlist than a documentation. The API has changed considerably since the 0.1 release, so be carefull when you upgrade after the next version is released.
